# Points and Reward Management System

A comprehensive **Points and Reward Database Management System (DBMS)** developed for **The Foodie**, a fast-food brand under the Grand Wooly conglomerate. This system is designed to enhance customer loyalty by providing an engaging platform for managing point-based transactions, membership tiers, and reward redemptions through both mobile and web platforms.

### ⚙️ Functional Scope

The system offers 10 key features:

1. **Customer-Initiated Transactions**  
   - Customers can earn points through purchases and redeem available rewards using accumulated points.

2. **Customer Payment Management**  
   - Multiple payment options supported: e-wallets, credit/debit cards, and online banking.  
   - Customers can review all past payments for transparency and personal tracking.

3. **Point Management System**  
   - Points are categorized as active or expired.  
   - Earned and expired points are updated automatically following defined rules.

4. **Membership Assignment**  
   - Tiered membership (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.) is assigned based on customer engagement and accumulated points.

5. **Tier-Based Benefits**  
   - Higher tiers unlock greater benefits (e.g., exclusive promotions, vouchers, free gifts).

6. **Transaction Information Access**  
   - Customers can view transaction details (Earn, Redeem) and statuses (Completed, Pending, Failed) with full history for transparency.

7. **Reward Redemption Using Points**  
   - Redeemable rewards are validated against stock availability and customer point balance.

8. **Real-Time Redemption Tracking**  
   - Customers can monitor the status of their redemptions (Pending, Completed, Cancelled).

9. **Reward Catalog Browsing**  
   - Customers can explore all available rewards, including descriptions and required points.

10. **Reward Restocking Management**  
    - Admins can monitor and manage reward stock levels to prevent over-redemption.
